  mso-fareast-language:EN-GB">Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr Olusegun Aganga, 
                has stated that Nigeria loses about N9.3 trillion annually to inaccurate measure 
                and billing points annually. Aganga stated this on Monday in Abuja at the launch 
                of the legal metrology web portal. Legal metrology is the science of measurement 
                which provides regulations for the control of measurements and measuring 
                instruments. It is an essential requirement which underpins the sale at both 
                retail and wholesale level of food, petrol and many other goods, a sector of 
                trade which accounts for more than 31.6 per cent of Nigerian’s gross domestic 
                product. Aganga said the Federal Government was poised to address the challenges 
                associated with measurement and billing, and thus approved the commencement of 
                the implementation of the new policy on weight and measures. The minister said 
                the implementation of the policy would help the Federal Government to save about 
                N474 billion annually and generate about N17billion this year. He explained that 
                the legal metrology would ensure proper inspection verification and 
                certification of metres to ensure proper billing system of electricity, water, 
                hydrocarbon and telecommunication, thereby eliminating N775 billion every month 
                due to inaccurate measure and billing points every month by Nigerians. The 
                minister said that the government was determined to ensure that adequate 
                measures were put in place to enable Nigerians to get value for local and 
                imported products. He said: “All over the world, there is legal metrology which 
                ensures that what you buy is accurate and legal. If you look at the Nigerian 
                Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative report, there is a lot of leakage in 
                the oil and gas industry, either because the metres are not working or they are 
                not installed at the right places. “But for the first time, President Goodluck 
                Jonathan has given us approval to commence that operation across all sectors of 
                the economy. We are starting with the oil and gas, telecoms and power sectors.” 
                Disclosing that the launch of the website, the first of its kind, would promote 
                accountability and transparency and increase revenue generation of the 
                government, the minister enjoined Nigerians to embrace legal metrology in all 
                the sectors of the economy. He said legal metrology is critical to the economic 
                advancement because it instils confidence in the domestic trade, protects the 
                consumers, as well as confer integrity on imported goods and products. Alhaji 
                Bashir Zoru, Director of Weight and Measure Department (WMD), described the 
                launch of the website as a key to fair trade in Nigeria. The director said 
                operation of the site would help to address the communication information and 
                empowerment challenges and assist the department to communicate better, and to 
                serve the public more effectively. Zoru said the department has identified the 
                website as a critical component of its PR and communication strategy to converse 
                with all stakeholders in general thus informing them of the latest information 
                in legal metrology, our policies and obligations.
