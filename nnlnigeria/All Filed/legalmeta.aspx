               <div class="box2"><strong>What is Legal Metrology?</strong><br>
 Metrology is the science of measurement. Legal metrology provides regulations for
the control of measurements and measuring instruments. Legal metrology also
provides protection of public safety, the environment, consumers, traders and is
critical to fair trade.<br>
Every day, consumers, traders, government regulators and industry make decisions based
on measurement results. These measurements affect economic and personal well being.
From a consumer's perspective, for example, a kilogram of rice must be a kilogram and no
less.</div><p style="clear:both;">
Legal metrology, or the science of  measurement, is an essential 
requirement which underpins the sale at both  retail and wholesale level
 of food, petrol and many other goods, a sector of  trade which accounts
 for more than 31.6% of Nigerian's gross domestic product. <br>
	    Legal weights and measures are  fundamental to a sustainable 
trading economy, the concept of sale and purchase  cannot exist without 
them. In our everyday lives people make many purchases  that rely on 
their confidence in the system that ensures correct measures, and  
likewise businesses need to know they are trading in a fair marketplace 
where  no one company has an unfair competitive advantage. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Key benefits derived from Legal Metrology   include;</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Reduced disputation and transaction costs; When a  process of measurements used in trade transactions lacks transparency and there  is asymmetry of information between  the  trader (providing) and buyer (accepting) measurements i.e. in retail trade,  farm produce and commercial transactions, this would lead to; </p>
<p>- Uncertainty<br />
  - Disputation<br />
  - Transaction  costs<br />
  - Market  inefficiency<br />
  And this  occurs daily in transactions such as; petroleum sales, billing of telephone  calls, transportation, electricity, water, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Consumer protection</strong><br />
  Measurement, and goods packed  by measure, has generally replaced number and simple measures (bucket, plate etc.)  as the basis of transaction for a wide range of consumer commodities and  products. The increased consistency of these measurements, when adequately  controlled, has significantly reduced disputation, fraud and increased the efficiency  of the market place</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Level playing field for  commerce</strong><br />
  Metrological control ensures  fair trading by eliminating the use of short measure to obtain commercial  advantage over competitors in the marketplace thus contributing to fair trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Effective stock control</strong><br />
  The aggregation of trade  measurement by individual businesses provides accurate and effective stock  control to facilitate the ordering of new stock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Control of fraud</strong><br />
  As well as the control of  fraud in the marketplace by state inspection, stock control by measurements can  also provide effective fraud control for individual businesses. Pattern  approval and certification also ensures that the design of measuring  instruments do not facilitate fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Full collection of  government excise and taxes based on measurement</strong><br />
  Governments of both developed  and developing nations collect significant amounts of revenue through excise  and resource rent taxes based on measurement. There are taxes based on weight and  volume i.e. fuel. All sources of government revenue and national income rely on  accurate and consistent measurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Full national benefit  for commodity exports</strong><br />
  Export income from the sale  by measure of bulk and pre-packaged commodities is a significant component of  both export and national income for many nations. In trade contracts to meet  the short measure requirement of trade contracts, commodity export countries  give away value to the extent of uncertainty of the measurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Support of global trade  in measuring instruments</strong><br />
  The development of  International Recommendations for the Pattern approval of measuring instruments  supports the global market for measuring instruments to internationally  recognised standards.      </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
      In Nigeria, a legislative and  practical enforcement programme through the Consultancy Service of <a name="NNL">Nigerco Nigeria Ltd. (NNL)</a> is in place to ensure this. All new weighing  and measuring equipment at the design stage has to be type approved by <strong>NNL</strong>
 to examine and test that it is fit for use. Before it is  used, it is 
verified to ensure its accuracy by a notified body, approved by  the 
Department of <a href="http://www.fmti.gov.ng/" target="_blank">Weight and Measurement of Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment</a>.
 While it is in use the trader will be responsible  for its ongoing 
maintenance and accuracy and correct use. On an ad hoc basis  Local 
Authority Trading Standards Services will independently inspect weighing
  and measuring equipment to ensure customers are receiving correct</p>
<p><br>
  To ensure that consumers and  businesses alike have confidence in 
  the system of Legal Weights and Measures in Nigeria, NNL works closely 
  with Local Authority, Trading  Standards Services, Independent Service Providers and collaborates with 
  manufacturers and suppliers. To ensure  that legal weights and measures 
  is practiced consistently throughout Africa and  the World, <strong>Nigerco Nig Ltd</strong> also plays an active part in  coordinating with <a href="http://www.welmec.org/" target="_new">WELMEC</a>, the European cooperation in legal  metrology and <a href="http://www.oiml.org/" target="_new">OIML</a>,
  the International Organisation of Legal  Metrology. This is so that 
  Nigerian consumers and businesses also have confidence in  legal 
  measurement when they trade or travel abroad. </p>
