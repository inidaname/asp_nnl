1. The ERP System is not browser independent; the working and the cascading is different in different browsers. It working is poor in internet explorer, fair in Mozilla, good in good chrome.

2. When the browser is minimized, the display cascading is not ok. All the contents get overlapped on one another. I think it'd be ok if the side menu can be in form of image or freezing mode that it can't be altered however d browser size.

3.  The droplist is most time not auto-populating the subsequent droplist... e.g. Selecting States to get local govt.

4.  Select image and automatically display would be better.

5.  The image should returns or show "No image when there's no image selected or uploaded by the applicants

6.  The "print out" is not well formated; and should bear the school logo.

7.  Login in with student Matric number is not understood and not working.

8.  Login pages for both student and staff do not have the school logo

9.  The Record Reports should be large 4 better viewing...

10.  The level of previleges are not functioning

11.  The some menu shouldn't be visible to some staff or to some students.

12.  The Admission Application Final page; the link "Click" is not working.

13. O'level Exam type should have "Other" exam type that the applicants can input other than the common ones like WAEC, NECO e.t.c
