        <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small">The Federal Government is making a move to ensure that Nigerians get value for 
        their money by introducing “Weights and Measures” across all the sectors of the 
        economy.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        The phrase weights and measures imply selling of goods by weight or measures 
        such as volume and length and it is backed with a range of rules. These rules 
        are&nbsp;designed to help customers understand how much they are buying and to ensure 
        they receive the amount of goods they are entitled to.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        Trade and Investment Minister, Olusegun Aganga, who disclosed this during 
        questions/answers session at a public forum in Lagos, said that this move will 
        also checkmate corruption in both public and private sector of the economy, 
        stressing: “It will first be introduced in the oil and gas industry.”</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        He said that the clamour for best practices in all human endeavours and the 
        desire to have accurate and effective service delivery informed the decision of 
        the federal government to include issues of weights and measures in one of its 
        Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) known as Weights and Measures 
        Division.</p>

            Minister of Trade &amp; Investment, Olusegun Aganga</p>
    </div>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        Accordingly, he said that the federal government has approved the request of the 
        Ministry of Trade and Investment to upgrade the division hitherto known as 
        Department of Trade&nbsp;to a full fledge Department of Weights and Measures to 
        enable it administer Weights and Measures in the country.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        He explained that the Department is empowered by Weights and Measures Act CAP 
        W3LFN, 2004 (Formally weights &amp; Measures Act CAP 467LFN 1999); Pre-Shipment 
        Inspection of Export Act CAP P25 LFN, 2004; Weights and Measures Standardization 
        of Indigenous Measures Regulations, 1992; and the Weights and Measures Fees 
        Regulations.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        “These laws empower the department to certify and check the compliance of all 
        measuring and weighing equipment in all sectors of the economy, including oil 
        and gas which includes creating uniformity in measurement of products in the 
        market in collaboration with state Ministries of Commerce and Industry; 
        Inspection of factories for compliance and accuracy of their measurement as well 
        as inspection of petrol retail &nbsp;for accurate dispensing of petrol, diesel and 
        kerosene at the pumps and&nbsp; inspection of measuring equipment at oil and gas 
        sector of the economy. (Both upstream and downstream),” he said.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        He also said that the department is charged with the care and custody of 
        Nigeria’s Primary Standards of Kilograms (KG) and Metre (M); verification of 
        pre-packaged goods such as bottles of soft drinks, bags of cement and flour; 
        issuance of type/pattern approval in respect of weighing and measuring 
        instruments manufactured locally and imported; prescribes necessary standards 
        for design and manufacture of indigenous measures used for the measurement of 
        grains and liquids; verification of the accuracy of telecommunications timers 
        and electricity meters; calibrating of weighing and measuring instruments on 
        request by companies, individuals and government organizations and enforcement 
        of the Pre-Shipment inspection of Export Act to ensure that the quantity of 
        crude exported out of the country is accurately known.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        “These responsibilities are geared toward ensuring that products are not under 
        dispensed at market, factories, oil and gas stations and crude oil depot in 
        Nigeria.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%">
        “This is a clear demonstration of Federal government’s seriousness in 
        entrenching transparency, accuracy and fairness in the Ministry by empowering 
        the department to monitor the accuracy of crude oil exported from Nigeria and 
        provide avenue for citizens to have value for their money in respect of accurate 
        dispensing of petroleum products at the filling stations,” he said.</span></p>
